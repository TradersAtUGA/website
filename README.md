This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First for dependicies run
npm install

Second, run the development server:

## Deploy to Netlify

Deploying a Next.js app to Netlify is pretty smooth, especially with the Netlify Next.js plugin. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you from build to live:

âœ… Step 1: Build Your Next.js App
If you havenâ€™t already:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-next-app@latest
Then build your app locally to test:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
npm run start
âœ… Step 2: Install Netlify CLI (optional but helpful)
This lets you test Netlify builds locally.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g netlify-cli
âœ… Step 3: Setup for Netlify
Install the Netlify Next.js Adapter Plugin:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @netlify/plugin-nextjs
Create a netlify.toml file in the root of your project:

toml
Copy
Edit
[build]
command = "npm run build"
publish = ".next"

[functions]
directory = "netlify/functions"

[[plugins]]
package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
âœ… The plugin handles dynamic routes, ISR, SSR, etc.

âœ… Step 4: Connect to Netlify
You have 2 options:

Option A: Use the Netlify CLI
bash
Copy
Edit
netlify init
It will guide you through linking the project to your Netlify account.

Option B: Use the Netlify UI
Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

Go to Netlify and click "Add new site" â†’ "Import from Git".

Select your repo.

Set build settings:

Build command: npm run build

Publish directory: .next

Netlify will detect itâ€™s a Next.js site if the plugin is installed and handle everything.

âœ… Step 5: Deploy
Every push to your repo will trigger a Netlify deploy. Or you can manually trigger it with:

bash
Copy
Edit
netlify deploy
Use --prod for a production deploy.

âœ… Bonus: Add Environment Variables
In the Netlify UI:

Go to your site â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables

Add anything like NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, etc.

ðŸ”„ TL;DR Build Summary
âœ… Install @netlify/plugin-nextjs

âœ… Add netlify.toml

âœ… Use netlify init or connect through the UI

âœ… Push to Git â†’ Netlify auto-deploys
